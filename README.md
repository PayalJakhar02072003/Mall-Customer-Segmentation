# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment mall customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score. The analysis helps understand customer behavior and can be useful for targeted marketing strategies.  

## 📂 Files in this Repository  
- **Mall_Customers.ipynb** → Jupyter/Colab notebook containing the full code (data preprocessing, clustering, visualization).  
- **Mall_Customers.csv** → Dataset used in the project (customer demographic and spending data).  

## 🚀 Steps in the Project  
1. Import required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).  
2. Load and explore the dataset.  
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  
4. Apply K-Means clustering.  
5. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.  
6. Visualize the final clusters of customers.  

## 📊 Results  
- Customers are segmented into clusters based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.  
- Useful insights for targeted marketing can be derived from the segmentation.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

## 📖 How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PayalJakhar02072003/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Open `Mall_Customers.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
3. Make sure `Mall_Customers.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.  
4. Run the cells step by step.
